This chapter covers the evaluation of reconstructions \(\tilde{f}\) obtained from the FCNN and the CNN through a comparison against reconstructions obtained from POD. Additionally, an analysis of the interpretability of the intrinsic variables \(\idhy\) and \(\idrare\) is provided. This chapter concludes with the attempt to create new states of the FOM with the FCNN and the CNN, which can be viewed as an online phase of MOR.\\ 
To begin with the benchmarking of POD and neural networks, the number of parameters to obtain \(\tilde{f}\) is contrasted. Beforehand solely the number of trainable parameters that compose both neural networks were called \(\frepar\). For this comparison, \(\frepar\) is extended to also include all elements of the left and right singular vectors as well as the singular values of POD. Additionally the amount of intrinsic variables used for reconstruction is set to \(p=3\) and \(p=5\) for \(\hy\) and \(\rare\) respectively. An exception is the CNN, that uses \(p=5\) independent from rarefaction level. A summary is provided in \cref{Tab: Parameters}.

\end{table}
POD uses with 15129 and 25225 parameters to reconstruct \(\hy\) and \(\rare\) respectively the largest amount of parameters of all three algorithms. These yield \(\L2\)-errors of 0.0205 and 0.0087 respectively. Interestingly, the elevation of \(p\) amounts to an increase of paramters by approximately 1.7 which is comparable to the FCNN with an approximate increase of 1.4. The FCNN, which holds the best \(\L2\)-errors of 0.0008 and 0.0009 for \(\hy\) and \(\rare\) respectively, does so with the least amount of parameters. For reconstructing \(\hy\) solely 2683 and for the reconstruction of \(\rare\) solely 3725 parameters are used, which is a fraction of the need for POD. The second most populous alhorithm is the CNN which uses 8246 parameters for both rarefaction levels. The resulting \(\L2\)-errors with 0.025 for \(\hy\) and 0.027 for \(\rare\) are the largest of all three algorithms. \\

Next a qualitative analysis with actual reconstructions is presented. For this purpose the \(\L2\)-error over time \(t\), seen in \cref{Fig:ErrTime}, is used to localize the most challenging snapshot for each algorithm.\\ 
\begin{figure}[tp!]
	\input{Figures/Chapter_5/ErrTime.tex}
	\caption{\(\L2\)-error over time for POD, FCNN and CNN. Results for $\hy$ are displayed on the left, the results for $\rare$ are displayed on the right.}
	\label{Fig:ErrTime}
\end{figure}
With POD and the CNN the last timestep at $t=0.12s$ for both rarefaction levels is the most rich in the $L2$-Error. In contrast, the FCNN does not show a distinct time dependence of the \(\L2\)-error. Nonetheless, struggles at the onset at around $t=0.005s$ with $\hy$ and around \(t=0.005s\) and \(t=0.0115\) (in the beginning and at the end) with $\rare$ can be observed for the FCNN. Examples of reconstructions $\tilde{f}(x,v,t_i)$ with $t_i=0.12s$ and $x \in [0.375,0.75]$ are given in \cref{Fig: ErrWorst}.\\
\begin{figure}[tp!]
	\input{Figures/Chapter_5/ErrWorst.tex}
	\caption{Comparison of the FOM solution \(f\) with three reconstructions \(\tilde{f}\) obtained from POD, the FCNN and the CNN. Reconstrucions are shown at \(t=0.12s\) for \(x\in [0.375,0.75]\). Case $\hy$ is displayed in the top row, $\rare$ in the bottom row. The colobars reference \(f\) and \(\tilde{f}\).}
	\label{Fig: ErrWorst}
\end{figure}
The FOM solution viewed as $f(x,v,t_i)$ has been introduced in \cref{Ch:BGK}. There, $f(x_j,v,t_i)$ is the probability distribution of the microscopic velocities $v$ at point $x_j$ in space at one moment $t_i$ in time for a gas.
With this in mind, a qualitative comparison between the three algorithms can be made considering the rendition of the velocity probabilities. Starting with \(\hy\), seen in the top row of \cref{Fig: ErrWorst} one can observe that \(\tilde{f}(x,v,t_i)\) starting around \(x=0.6\) gets defective for POD and the CNN. Noteworthy, here the probability distribution is thinner as the original with POD. This in turn leads to errors in the temperature \(T\) once passing \(x\approx 0.6\). Prominent qualitative deviations using the CNN are especially blurriness/pixelation of \(\tilde{f}(x,v,t_i)\) after \(x\approx 0.6\). In contrast the FCNN seems to reproduce the FOM solution almost exactly.\\
Continuing with a row further down in \cref{Fig: ErrWorst} and therefore with \(\rare\). The FCNN seems to reproduce the FOM solution without any visible drawback. Also POD seems to reproduce all important structures, except after \(x\approx 0.7\) around the contact discontinuity, some values for velocities with \(v>0\) appear to be missing. Again the CNN struggles with blurriness making \(\tilde{f}\) for both rarefaction levels look largely similar.    
\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Matching of macroscopic quantities \(\rho\), \(\rho u\) and \(E\) reproduced by POD, the FCNN the and CNN with macroscopic quantities computed from the FOM.

	\label{Fig:ErrMacro}
\end{figure}
Loss of information described above can unfold in severe mistakes in \(\rho\), \(\rho u\) and \(E\), the macroscopic quantities, as displayed in \cref{Fig:ErrMacro}. Examining the macroscopic quantities enables a detailed look on the reconstruction errors. Features of the macroscopic quantities are expressed in terms of rarefaction wave, contact discontinuity and height as well as position of the shockfront. For a detailed elaboration of these terms see \cref{Ch:BGK}. Following the structure in the preceding figures, macroscopic quantities of \(\hy\) are displayed in the top row and for \(\rare\) in the bottom row of \cref{Fig:ErrMacro}. First the reproduction of the macroscopic quantities \(\rho\) and \(\rho u\)  obtained by the FCNN match the FOM exact for both levels of rarefaction \(\hy\) and \(\rare\). Interestingly, despite the overall impressive performance of the FCNN regarding the small number of parameters it uses, the total energy shows small deviations around the tail of the rarefaction wave for \(\hy\) and somewhat severe errors at the transition form rarefaction wave to shock front for \(\rare\). Second the CNN produces trembles in \(\rho u\) and especially in \(E\) which is why it's shown with marks only. The macroscopic quantities reproduced by the CNN show unmissable, it's inabillity to differentiate between \(\hy\) and \(\rare\). Specifically, seem the macroscopic quantities for \(\rare\) appear to be a copy of the the ones for \(\hy\). Additionally, considering \(\hy\), one can observe, that the momentum \(\rho u\) holds small errors for the tail of the rarefaction wave as well as the contact discontinuity. The value for the tip of the shockwave exceeds, comparable with POD, the exact solution. Third POD performs better on \(\rare\), which is not suprising considering the the difference in number of used parameters, holding only small deviations of the contact discontinuity and the shockwave for the momentum \(\rho u\) and the total energy \(E\). The density \(\rho\) matches the FOM solution exact. Pronounced deviations from the FOM solution occur using POD on \(\hy\). The density \(\rho\) undercuts the original shockwave. The momentum \(\rho u\) heavily exceeds the tail of the rarefaction wave and in the same extent undercuts the contact discontinuity. Hence in the total energy \(E\) the same is obersvable for the tail of the rarefaction wave and the contact discontinuity.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\input{Figures/Chapter_5/Conservation.tex}
	\caption{Comparison of the conservative properties of reconstructions obatined from POD, the FCNN and the CNN against the conservative properties of the FOM solution using the temporal mean.}
	\label{Fig:Conservation}
\end{figure}
The physical consistency of \(\tilde{f}\), in terms of conservation of mass momentum and energy is a critical criteria for it's validity. Hence conservation properties are analyzed in the following. In that respect, the temporal mean over the time derivative, which can be calculated exemplary for \(\rho\) with
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\int \rho(x,t)\, \mathrm{d}x\Delta t  =\overline{\dot{\rho}}\mathrm{,}
\end{equation}
of the macroscopic quantities is employed. \Cref{Fig:Conservation} shows the conservation of mass, momentum and total energy as a temporal mean for \(\hy\) in the top row and for \(\rare\) in the bottom row.\\
Conservation of mass is met using the FCNN, except for small deviations at the outset for both cases \(\hy\) and \(\rare\). Similarly, does POD meet conservation of mass for \(\rare\). The erroneous \(\hy\) case losses mass at the onset and gains mass towards the end with POD. Conservation of momentum meets the FOM solution, except for minor gains and losses, after \(t\approx 0.03s\) using the FCNN for both cases \(\hy\) and \(\rare\). POD gains momentum of 0.13 for \(\hy\) and 0.07 for \(\rare\). The conservation of total energy is met for \(\hy\) and \(\rare\) using POD and the FCNN. Finally the reconstructions of the CNN do not conserve mass, momentum nor total energy. All conservative properties behave comparable to a sawtooth wave. A gain and loss of either of the quantities can be observed.\\
In conclusion the error over time for the CNN is disordered, showing gain and subsequent loss of information from one timestep to another. The CNN performs slighly better with \(\hy\) than with \(\rare\). What is hidden when looking at reconstructions becomes visible when verifying over the macroscopic quantities. Reconstructions obtained from the CNN show oscillations in the momentum \(\rho u\) and the total energy \(E\). On top of that the CNN does not meet conservation in any of the conservative properties. All of this together makes the CNN with this setup, especially the access to only 40 samples, unsuited for building a ROM. Next POD shows a noticeable increase in loss of information over time for both cases \(\hy\) and \(\rare\). Reconstructions of the last timestep as well as the macroscopic quantities at that time reveal that the POD is unsuited for building a ROM with the \(\hy\)case. However, with \(\rare\) POD shows only slight deviations from the FOM solution. Taking conservative properties of the reconstructions obtained from POD into consideration only underlines aforementioned findings. Ultimately POD could be taken for building a ROM with \(\rare\). Finally the the FCNN is the best performing model out of the three for both cases \(\hy\) and \(\rare\), while the performance for \(\hy\) is slightly better than that for \(\rare\). The error over time reveals a constant low loss. Only at the first time steps a noticeable loss of information is observed. Reconstructions of the last time step and the macroscopic quantities at that time are close to exact to the FOM solution for both cases \(\hy\) and \(\rare\). The conservation of the macroscopic quantites only emphasize the proximity to the FOM solution. In total the FCNN is suited for building a ROM with both cases \(\hy\) and \(\rare\) and will be taken further into the online phase.\\
We now reached the online phase where we want to be independent from the FOM solution. A first ROM relying on pure interpolation in the intrinsic variables is performed for \(\hy\). The intrinsic variables of the FCNN for \(\hy\) are shown in ... . 

With POD one usually exploits the intrinsic variables within a Galerkin framework as in \cite{Bernard} to produce new states. The same can be done with the intrinsic variables obtained from autoencoders as in \cite{Carlberg}. Both won't be discussed in this contribution. Rather new states are obtained by interpolating \(\idhy\) and \(\idrare\) in time \(t\). This approach tests a different kind of generalization about the FOM solution. Therefore this kind of generalization ability of the proposed autoencoder architectures will be analyzed.

\subsection{Discussion and Outlook}
 One reason of the lacking ability of the CNN is the small number of samples, as described in \cref{Ch:ApB} and \cref{Ch:ROM}. The resulting trembles of the signal when calculating the macroscopic quantities is due the kernel approach of the CNN. During reconstruction the resolution of the output image is bounded by the size of the kernel, which leads to pixelation.\\
  What we see here is the known drawback of POD. Sharp fronts and especially advection dominated problems lead to a fast decaying kogolomorov n-width. These problems need a nonlienar ansatz, as described in \cref{Ch:ROM}.
